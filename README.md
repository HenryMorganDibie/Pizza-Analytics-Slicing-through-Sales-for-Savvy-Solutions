# Pizza-Analytics-Slicing-through-Sales-for-Savvy-Solutions
Using Python for data manipulation and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard, I analyzed pizza sales data to uncover customer trends, popular pizzas, revenue insights, and seasonality patterns for informed business decisions.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this analysis contains a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place. It includes the following variables:

- Date and Time: Timestamps of each order.
- Pizzas Served: Details on the pizzas served, including type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

The dataset provides insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and popular menu items, enabling strategic decision-making for the pizza place.

## Analysis Results:
### Number of Customers per Day:

The dataset covers 358 days in 2015, with varying daily customer counts ranging from 27 to 73.
Fridays and Thursdays exhibit higher customer engagement compared to Sundays and Mondays.

### Number of Orders per Hour:

Distinct peak hours for pizza orders are observed, with significant demand around 12 PM (noon), indicating peak lunchtime demand.

### Average Number of Pizzas per Order and Bestselling Pizzas:

On average, customers order approximately 2.32 pizzas per order.
The top five bestselling pizzas include "The Classic Deluxe Pizza," "The Barbecue Chicken Pizza," and "The Hawaiian Pizza."

### Total Revenue for the Year and Monthly Revenue Trends:

The total revenue for 2015 amounted to $817,860.05.
Monthly revenue trends show fluctuations, with peak revenue in July and lowest in September.

### Pizza Sales Analysis:

Top-selling pizzas such as "The Classic Deluxe Pizza" and "The Barbecue Chicken Pizza" consistently attract high orders.
Pizzas with lower sales volumes, like "The Brie Carre Pizza," may benefit from promotional efforts or menu adjustments.


In conclusion, this analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and opportunities for optimization for the fictitious pizza place. The pizza place can make informed decisions to enhance profitability and customer satisfaction by understanding peak hours, popular menu items, and revenue trends.
